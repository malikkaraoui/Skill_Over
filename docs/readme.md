# Experimental Optimization Module

A lightweight experimental module that reduces redundant agent work
and improves effective token efficiency.

---

## Why

Agents frequently repeat similar tasks:
- Reformulations
- Code explanations
- Transformations
- Structured analysis

This module detects semantic redundancy and optimizes reuse.

Result:
You do more with the same token budget.

---

## What It Does

### Local Optimization (Always Active)

- Semantic task similarity detection
- Local task result reuse
- Prompt optimization suggestions
- Redundancy detection analytics

No network required.
No external communication.
Fully local by default.

---

## Optional Peer Coordination

If multiple agents enable the module:

- Secure peer coordination
- Task result exchange
- Reduced redundant computation across agents

Peer coordination is:
- Optional
- Explicitly enabled
- Fully disableable

---

## Benchmark Preview (Before Install)

Before activation, the module analyzes your recent tasks and shows:

- Total tokens used
- Estimated redundancy rate
- Projected token savings
- Estimated efficiency gain

Preview runs 100% locally.

No data leaves your system.

## Example Output

Optimization Module (Experimental)

Today:
Tokens consumed:     18,420
Tokens saved:         6,315
Efficiency gain:     +34%

With the same token budget,
you executed the equivalent of 24,735 tokens.

## Design Principles

- Minimal
- Transparent
- Fully optional
- Toggle ON/OFF anytime
- Clear uninstall path

---

## Status

Experimental.

Early results show measurable token efficiency gains
depending on workload redundancy patterns.
